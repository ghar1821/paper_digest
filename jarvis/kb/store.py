"""
Knowledge base using LangChain + ChromaDB.

Single unified collection with a flat document schema. All content —
papers, vault notes, local PDFs — is chunked and stored as LangChain
Documents with consistent metadata.

Document schema
---------------
  page_content : str   — chunked text (embedded for similarity search)
  metadata:
    date_added  : str  — ISO timestamp of when the chunk was indexed
    doc_type    : str  — "paper" | "note" | "chat" (past chat exchanges) |
                         "digest" (indexed weekly digest .md files)
    visibility  : str  — "public" | "private" (papers are always public)
    source      : str  — arXiv/DOI URL for papers, file:/// URI for local
                         PDFs and digest files, "local" for vault notes,
                         "session:<id>" for chat exchanges
    title       : str  — display title (optional)
    authors     : str  — comma-separated authors, papers only (optional)
    doi         : str  — DOI for papers, regex/LLM-inferred for local PDFs (optional)
    score       : int  — relevance score 0-10, papers only (optional)
    track       : str  — research track label, papers only (optional)
    file_path   : str  — vault-relative path for notes, absolute for PDFs (optional)
    content_hash: str  — SHA-256 of full file, used for change detection
    chunk_index : int  — position of this chunk within its source document
    section     : str  — markdown header breadcrumb ("H1 › H2"), "" if none
    storage_mode: str  — "summary" | "full_text" (optional)
    modified_at : str  — ISO mtime of the source file, vault notes only (optional)

  PDF annotation and figure chunks (see add_annotations / add_figures)
  additionally carry:
    annotation_kind : str — "highlight" | "comment" | "figure" (absent on body chunks)
    page            : int — 1-indexed PDF page the annotation/figure came from
    note_text       : str — the user's typed comment, "" if none (always "" for figures)
  They share source/file_path/doc_type/visibility with the parent PDF's body
  chunks, so every existing delete path sweeps them along automatically.
  Figure chunks store a vision-model caption prefixed "[FIGURE p.N]".

Privacy model
-------------
  "public"  — accessible to all providers (local Ollama and Anthropic)
  "private" — accessible to the local model only

  search_with_privacy_check() enforces this at query time:
  - cloud provider  → searches public docs only; reports whether private
                       docs also matched so the user can be warned
  - local provider  → searches all docs without restriction

    - "Error finding id": the index could not resolve a chunk id. This used to
      be diagnosed as on-disk corruption, which was wrong — it was a process
      holding a cached copy of the vector index while another process rewrote
      it, and it went away the moment that reader was restarted. The server
      owns the index now, so a reader cannot hold a stale copy at all, and a
      one-shot command on the direct path opened the index moments ago. If it
      still appears, the index genuinely cannot resolve its own ids, and a
      rebuild is the answer.

    - "Collection [...] does not exist": survives the move to a server. A
      client resolves a collection to an id once, and `kb reindex` swaps in a
      rebuilt collection with a new id, so a process that was already

    This is the slowest build step by far — one vision call per figure — so

    enabled=None follows cfg.figure_captions (off by default); enabled=True

    `kb add --figures` and the chat tool's with_figures. It never overrides
    the privacy guard below, only the config kill-switch.

    The embedded text is prefixed "[FIGURE p.N]" so retrieval can tell captions
    apart from body prose. Metadata mirrors the parent PDF's body chunks (same
    source/file_path/doc_type/visibility, annotation_kind="figure") so deletes
    and re-ingests sweep figures together with the body and annotations.

    skipped entirely with a visible warning and nothing is written. Papers are
