"""
jarvis-sync — supervised background daemon.

Run directly in a terminal with `uv run jarvis-sync` — it stays in the
foreground and owns up to five APScheduler jobs (everything is scheduled;
there is no filesystem-event watcher and no worker thread):

  1. Weekly arXiv digest (cron trigger), only when [digest] enabled is true —
     it is off by default. Runs missed while asleep fire on wake via misfire
     handling.
  2. Digest catch-up (every 6 hours, and once at startup), registered with
     the digest job and skipped alongside it. Re-checks the persistent
     last-success stamp against the cron schedule and runs the digest if a
     slot was missed while the machine was powered off — so a missed Monday
     no longer waits until the next Monday or a restart. A non-blocking lock
     keeps the cron job and the catch-up job from ever running the digest
     twice at once.
  3. Periodic PDF inbox scan (every pdf_watch_minutes). New/changed PDFs in
     cfg.pdf_watch_dir are indexed full-text as public papers, with
     annotations; byte-hash dedup makes the scan idempotent, so saving a
     highlight costs at most one re-ingest per interval rather than one per
     save. The folder is an inbox, not a mirror — removing a file never
     deletes its KB entry.
  4. Periodic Obsidian vault refresh — the existing hash-based incremental
     sync in refresh_vault(), on an interval.
  5. Daily draft retention sweep — removes drafts in the agent-writable
     sandbox that nothing has touched for [drafts] retention_days. This is the
     only scheduled job that deletes anything; kept drafts are exempt and
     retention_days = 0 switches it off.

Every job body catches its own exceptions and records the outcome in
~/.jarvis/state/sync_status.json (read by `kb sync-status`); one failing job
never takes the daemon down. Fatal setup problems (bad config, embedding-model
mismatch) exit non-zero (see the message printed to the log for why).

Logging goes to ~/.jarvis/logs/sync.log by default, plus stderr so a
foreground run shows the same messages live. Restart-on-crash is up to
whatever keeps the process running (your terminal, a process manager, etc.)
— the daemon itself makes no assumptions about that.

The daemon does not manage other daemons: if the provider is local and
Ollama is down, the digest job fails with a pointer to the docs.
